# Phase 10: Final Review, Cleanup & Documentation

**Goal:** Ensure code quality, remove unused code, add necessary comments/documentation, and prepare the project for presentation/submission.

**Sub-tasks:**

1.  **Task 10.1: Code Review and Refactoring**

    - **Description:** Review all code for clarity, consistency, performance, and adherence to best practices. Refactor where necessary.
    - **Expected Outcome:** Clean, maintainable, and performant codebase.
    - **Affected:** Entire codebase.
    - **Development:** Systematically go through components, utilities, pages. Look for repetitive code, overly complex functions, unclear variable names, etc. Apply principles like DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
    - **References:** All previous phases, `assignment.md` (clean code requirement).

2.  **Task 10.2: Remove Unused Code and Console Logs**

    - **Description:** Identify and remove any dead code, unused variables, commented-out old code, and temporary console log statements.
    - **Expected Outcome:** A lean codebase with no superfluous elements.
    - **Affected:** Entire codebase.
    - **Development:** Use linters, IDE tools, or manual inspection to find unused code. Search for `console.log` and remove.
    - **References:** All previous phases.

3.  **Task 10.3: Add Code Comments and Documentation**

    - **Description:** Add comments to explain complex logic, non-obvious decisions, or component props. Update or create a `README.md` with setup and run instructions.
    - **Expected Outcome:** Code is easier to understand. Project is easy to set up and run by others.
    - **Affected:** Code files, `README.md`.
    - **Development:** Write JSDoc/TSDoc for functions and components. Explain any intricate parts. Update README with clear instructions on installation, running dev server, running tests.
    - **References:** All previous phases.

4.  **Task 10.4: Final Manual Testing and QA**

    - **Description:** Perform thorough manual testing of the application, covering all user flows, input variations, and edge cases.
    - **Expected Outcome:** Application is stable and behaves as expected under various conditions.
    - **Affected:** The running application.
    - **Development:** Test form submissions with valid/invalid data, different airport selections, various dates, empty results, etc. Check responsiveness (Task 8.6).
    - **References:** All functional phases (3-7), Phase 8 (Styling).

5.  **Task 10.5: Check All Assignment Requirements**

    - **Description:** Re-read `assignment.md` and ensure all stated requirements (Next.js, TypeScript, unit tests, data usage) have been met.
    - **Expected Outcome:** Full compliance with the assignment brief.
    - **Affected:** The entire project delivery.
    - **Development:** Create a checklist from `assignment.md` and verify each point.
    - **References:** `assignment.md`.

6.  **Task 10.6: Prepare for Presentation (If Applicable)**
    - **Description:** If the project needs to be presented, prepare talking points, consider demo flows, and ensure the application runs smoothly in the presentation environment.
    - **Expected Outcome:** A well-prepared presentation of the project.
    - **Affected:** N/A (Process task).
    - **Development:** Outline key features, challenges, and solutions. Practice the demo.
    - **References:** `assignment.md` (mentions presentation at interview).
